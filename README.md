# winterm.vim

## Deprecation

Quite short after the creation of this plugin, the functionality was introduced into native vim. 
You *should* be able to use vim in Windows Terminal without this package now.

## Description

A plugin to set the cursor shape in Windows Terminal. Use this instead of
setting termcaps, which are not supported on Windows.

Based on [this comment](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/68#issuecomment-1183955504) by *hulucc*.

## Install

Use a plugin manager.
