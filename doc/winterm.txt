*winterm.txt*   Plugin to output cursors properly in Windows Terminal

You should not set ANSI escape codes when using Windows, the fact that it
almost works is entirely coincidental. Instead, use this plugin.

                                                *winterm-settings*
*g:winterm_dll* The path to the library to print a cursor number.

Cursor shapes:
| Variable | Default | Default appearance | Mode |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| *g:winterm_nCursor* | 2 | solid block | Normal |
| *g:winterm_iCursor* | 5 | vertical bar | Insert |
| *g:winterm_RCursor* | 4 | underline | Replace (continuous) |
| *g:winterm_rCursor* | 4 | underline | replace (single character) |

You can change these to your own liking, search online for "cursor shape ansi
codes". The variable is just supposed to be a number.
